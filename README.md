# JS_NODE_VUE_catalog_products_back_end

Finished first sprint. 
I did all steps that you told me as title and description must be unique and description canÂ´t be longer 50 words.
And i did too, function to create articles, find articles and detele them.
Remind to do a npm install because i created a .gitignore file and i used doenv but i save it github so, you can see it

Thanks
